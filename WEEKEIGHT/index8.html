<h1>Reflection:</h1>
<br>

<b>1. Learning how users interact with web applications is one of the most fundamental pieces of your web development toolbox. How is using JavaScript to interact with an application important? Just like your video explanations I would like to see and hear about some specific real world examples.</b>
<br>

    <i>Javascript is still quite a struggle for me. I'm sure I'll be able to get a better grip on it during my time here. I think it's the most important language within webdevelopement though because it makes your webpage become more livlier. </i>
<br><br>

<b>2. You have seen a lot of hardships caused by not knowing about the DOM or JavaScript answered in this course (think event listeners instead of complex UI animations for navbar interactions). What were some of the things made easier by learning about DOM interactions? What was hard, difficult, or surprising to you and why?</b>
<br>
    <i>Learning about the DOM made things a lot more clearer for me. Before pursuing this certificate, I always played around in the DEvTools online just to see what it does and this course has certainly made things a lot of clearer for me.</i>   
<br><br>


3.<b> What do you feel was your biggest accomplishment in this course?
<br></b>
    <i>I honestly don't feel like I accomplishment as much as I should have and that's my fault. I let a lot of personal problems get in the way of my school work and it affected me. I will admit that it is certainluy a lesson learned.</i>
